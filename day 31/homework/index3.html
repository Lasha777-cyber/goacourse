<!-- An external style sheet is used when you want to define styles for multiple pages.
Here is how it works:
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section. -->
<!-- Internal CSS is a method for defining CSS styles directly within an HTML document. It's particularly useful for applying unique styles to a single web page, and it's embedded within the <style> element located in the <head> section of the HTML file.
How to Use Internal CSS ?
To use internal CSS, you need to include CSS rules within a <style> tag inside the HTML document's <head>. This allows you to define styles by selecting HTML elements or classes and applying styling rules within the tag. The styles defined by internal CSS apply only to the specific web page where they are included. -->
<!-- Inline CSS applies styles directly to HTML elements using the style attribute, allowing for quick, unique styling without external stylesheets.
Quick Application: Ideal for rapid, one-off style adjustments.
High Specificity: Overrides other CSS rules due to its specificity.
Limited Reusability: Not suitable for applying the same styles to multiple elements. -->
